# Thwomp

![Thwomp](Thwomp.png)

Thwomp is a four oscillator drum synthesizer for [Max for Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/). It's a [subtractive synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_synthesis) that specializes in making drum sounds with the following features:

- Fixed frequency by default, as most drum sounds aren't played chromatically.
- Prominent pitch envelope for creating kick drums.
- No sustain or release, because those aren't features of percussive instruments.

Thwomp's interface is designed to be transparent and predictable. Every parameter is labeled with its [unit type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement).

## Installation

Drag `max-for-live/instruments/Thwomp.amxd` to `User Library/Presets/Instruments/Max Instrument/`. There's an optional `install.sh` script that will do this automatically.

## Stand-Alone Mode

To open any of the `maxpat` files, the Sidewinder folder should be in your [Project Search Paths](https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/vignettes/projects_searchpath), `~/Documents/Max 8/Projects` by default, so that referenced files can be found.

Thwomp can also be opened in standalone mode by opening the `misc/instruments/Thwomp.maxpat`  outside of Ableton Live, it offers some additional features.

- **Button**: Trigger the MIDI note
- **Pitch**: Select the MIDI note pitch
- **Velocity**: Select the MIDI note velocity
- DAC Toggle: Toggles whether the audio engine is on
- Typing the `s` will play the note

## Global Parameters

- **Volume**: The volume of all of the oscillators combined.
- Oscillator Tabs 1-4: Select an oscillator

### Presets

- **R**: Read presets from a file
- **W**: Write the presets to a file
- **OW**: When toggled on, **W** will automatically write again to the sample file
- To recall a preset, click a box

## Ableton Push

Thwomp support Ableton Push. When using Push, the leftmost knob always chooses the selected Oscillator. There's four different banks that allow all of Thwomp's parameters to be accessed.

### Banks

- Main
- Oscillator
- Envelope
- Filter
